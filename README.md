installing python...<br>
`$brew install python`->(mac)<br>
first off... you must have python installed(its better if you install the latest version because in python 3.7 many tkinter methods were deprecated). To know how to install brew <a href="https://brew.sh/">click here</a>.

<br>
installing pymongo...<br>



`$python -m pip install pymongo`->(windows & mac...and this is obvious but make sure you are connected to internet).<br>
It's recommended to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> to install pymongo.(Since Python 3.4, pip is bundled with the Python installation package... if you are using latest python verson you dont need to manually install pip).<br>
If any problem while installing on windows <a href="http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/installation.html/">click here</a><br>
If you are using pycharm IDE then make sure to add the pymongo package to you python interpreter. <br><br>
MongoDB database is hosted on mlab... no need to install mongoDB.<br><br>
zapy.py is the entry point of the application. So just cd into the root folder and run<br>
`$python zapy.py`<br><br>
P.S this application was created on mac and cuz of display resoultion issues the layout gets a bit messed up on low resolution screen.<br><br>
